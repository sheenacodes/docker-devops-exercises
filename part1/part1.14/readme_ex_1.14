Dockerfile_dev can be used as Dockerfile in dev environment without making any changes

However to run in production, changes were made

added new file config/secret.yml with content:
production:
  secret_key_base: <%= ENV["SECRET_KEY_BASE"] %>

Following line was uncommented in Gemfile
gem 'redis', '~> 4.0'

With these changes Dockerfile_prod works in production
